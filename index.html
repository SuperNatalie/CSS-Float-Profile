        Although she earned little public recognition during her lifetime, Ada
        Lovelace is now considered a pioneer and prophet of the computer age. In
        the first entry to his book Innovators, Walter Isaacson wrote: “Like
        Steve Jobs, [Ada Lovelace] stands at the intersection of arts and
        technology.” <br />
        At 26, encouraged by her husband, Lovelace returned to assisting her
        friend and mentor Charles Babbage, known as the father of the computer,
        on a project called “The Analytical Engine.” During this time, she was
        asked to translate Italian engineer Luigi Meneabrea’s lecture notes from
        French to English. She found many errors and expanded on the original in
        her footnotes. <br />
        Thanks to those notes on the engine, Lovelace is now widely recognized
        as the first computer programmer.

    <h2>Grace Hopper – <br />“Amazing Grace,” Queen of Software</h2>

      <p>
        Grace Hopper was a computer scientist, Yale Ph.D, and United States Navy
        Rear Admiral who also—on top of everything else—helped pioneer computer
        programming. “Humans are allergic to change,” she once said. “They love
        to say, ‘We’ve always done it this way.’ I try to fight that. That’s why
        I have a clock on my wall that runs counter-clockwise.” <br />
        During her illustrious career, Hopper worked on UNIVAC I, the first
        commercial computer produced in the U.S., and created the first
        compiler. She is also credited with coining the term “computer bug” when
        she found a real moth inside the massive UNIVAC I. If that wasn’t
        enough, Hopper also invented FLOW-MATIC, the first English-like data
        processing language, which helped spark the development of COBOL, which
        eventually became the Navy’s standard operating language.
